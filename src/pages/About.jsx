                        <p>Hi! My name is Camille and I'm a full stack developer!
                            I have a Bachelor of Science in Marketing and a minor in Documentary Studies from the University of Utah.
                            I've spent two and a half years working in the music industry. I'm passionate about creating applications that align with my interests.
                            I see a lot of synergies between music and tech,
                            so I am excited to expand my skill set in the world of coding.
                            I enjoy traveling, all things crafting, going to concerts and cooking! Food is my love language! üç∞
