                <p>Hi! My name is Camille and I'm on my way to becoming a full-stack developer!
                    I have a Bachelor of Science in Marketing and a minor in Documentary Studies from the University of Utah. 
                    I've spent two and a half years working in the music industry. 
                    I see a lot of synergies between music and tech,
                    so I am excited to expand my skill set in the world of coding.
                    I enjoy traveling, all things crafting, going to concerts and cooking! Food is my love language! üç∞
