# React Portfolio

## Description
This is my portfolio I built using React! It is designed to showcase my skills as a full stack web developer. This project taught me: 
* How to start a React project using Vite
* How to import and begin using React hooks such as useState and useRef
* How to use NavLink from React Router DOM to create a dynamic single page app with a functioning navigation bar
* How to organize components and reuse them on various pages
* How to use media queries for a responsive, mobile-first design
* Form validation through helper functions and the useRef hook
* How to work with props
* and more
